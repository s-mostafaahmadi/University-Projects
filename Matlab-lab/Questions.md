### MATLAB Programming Exercises

1. **Addition of Two Numbers Using a Function**  
   Write a function named `adder` that takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns their sum as output.

2. **Delta Calculation**  
   Write a function named `delta` that takes three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c` and calculates the delta.

3. **Image Display and Processing**  
   Read the image `cameraman.tif` and resize it to `[100,100]`.  
   Apply a Gaussian filter with a size of `[100,100]` and a standard deviation of 20 to the image and display the result.

4. **Using Loops and Conditionals**  
   Write a program that takes an input number from the user and calculates its factorial using a `for` loop.  
   Perform the same operation using a `while` loop.

5. **Matrix Processing**  
   Define a 4x6 matrix and scale the values from the third row and column.

6. **Removing Specific Elements in a Matrix**  
   Write a program that defines a matrix named `number` and removes the subsequent elements upon reaching the value 237.

7. **Image Processing**  
   Read the image `Lenna.png` and add salt & pepper noise to it. Then, correct it using a mean filter.  
   Rotate the image `cameraman.tif` and display the result.

8. **Creating and Applying a Filter**  
   Create a Laplacian filter with a size of 80 and apply it to the image `cameraman.tif`.

9. **Plotting Graphs**  
   Take three input numbers from the user and calculate the perimeter and area of three circles, then plot them.
